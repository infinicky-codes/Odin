    <h1>Homepage</h1>
        <!-- To add links, use the anchor tag with a reference attribute in the opening tag: -->
        <p>
            Links to pages on other websites on the internet are called absolute links. An absolute link will always contain the protocol and domain of the destination (protocol://domain/path).
            
            <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/about">click me</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            Links to other pages within our own website are called relative links. Relative links do not include the domain name, since it is another page on the same site, it assumes the domain name will be the same as the page we created the link on.
            
            <a href="./pages/about.html">About</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            Prepending ./ before the link will in most cases prevent issues. By adding ./ you are specifying to your code that it should start looking for the file/directory <em>relative</em> to the current directory.
        </p>
        <p>If you&rsquo;re into &ldquo;web typography&rdquo;, you&rsquo;ll also find
            yourself using curly quotes quite a bit.</p>
